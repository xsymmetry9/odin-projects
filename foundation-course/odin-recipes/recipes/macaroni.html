        <p>A very quick and easy fix to a tasty side-dish. Fancy, designer mac and cheese often costs forty or 
            fifty dollars to prepare when you have so many exotic and expensive cheeses, 
            but they aren't always the best tasting. This recipe is cheap and tasty.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredient</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instruction</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, 
                stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in flour, salt, and pepper until smooth, about 5 minutes. 
                Slowly pour milk into butter-flour mixture while continuously stirring until mixture is 
                smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Add Cheddar cheese to milk mixture and 
                stir until cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Fold macaroni into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
        </ol>
