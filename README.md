# Odin Projects

I began my journey into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through The Odin Project. This folder is a collection of the projects I completed as part of that curriculum. While I didnâ€™t finish the entire course, I gained valuable hands-on experience and a solid foundation in front-end development.

These projects mark the beginning of my coding journey. Going forward, my focus is on writing cleaner code and building well-structured, maintainable projects. I plan to take on more complex challenges and start solving real-world problems through code.
