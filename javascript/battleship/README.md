## Functions
- Players are able to place their ships randomly on their board.
- Player is able to play against the AI.
- Players are able to play as many times as possible after the game finishes.

## Extra
- A 2 player option where users can take turns by passing the laptop or device back and forth.
- Implemented drag and drop to allow players to place their ships.

## Improvements need to be made
- Press a button every time you finish your move.  This gives player time to pass their laptop or device to another person
- When placing the ship, user has a choice to click on the ship and delete, edit, or rotate it.
- Calculates how many times the user has won against the computer
- User is able to choose 2 levels, implementing an algorithm that allows computer to use "the next best move".
